Description

Robby Bob is cute little robot which doesn't claim complexity. It is just cute :bowtie:

However, its claims are:
---------------
- to be under the spotlight whenever he's in the/a room;
- to always win (depending on the settings - it could be a player or a teacher)
- to make you smile :relieved:

Let's hook on
